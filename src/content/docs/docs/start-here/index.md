## Welcome to Vote Manager Integrations!

This is your entry point to understanding our Developer API. Our API is a powerful tool designed to allow you to easily integrate your app, bot or website with Vote Manager's advanced vote tracking & rewarding systems and, when combined with our Integrations Platform, you can integrate Vote Manager with any kind of app you can think of, and even some you can't!

In this documentation, we'll guide you through the ins and outs of our API in a straightforward manner. You won't find any unnecessary technical jargon here. Instead, we'll focus on providing clear instructions and examples to help you integrate our API seamlessly into your projects.

First, you will need to make sure you've got at least 1 Integration in our [Integrations Portal](/integrations). If you don't, then you can reach out to a member of the Vote Manager team. Once you tell them about your app and how you want to integrate, they will get you setup with everything you need.

If you have already got an Integration, lucky you - you can get started with custom rewards and TagScript now, right [here](/docs/start-here/getting-started)

Now go and build something awesome!
